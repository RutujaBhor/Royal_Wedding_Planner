		<p>Design and décor is an indispensible part of the wedding ceremony. Most of the time, the décor of the wedding venue depends upon the 
		imagination of the host who has dreamt about it since his daughter’s birth. But, as he is very busy with the details of the wedding, he is not able to the 
		scene at his leisure. While planning the wedding, most often the theme of design and décor is the first step. The hosts have to 
		make decision such as whether it should be Indian or western. This is a vast subject as the hosts have to decide the décor for many 
		wedding ceremonies such as bridal shower, Mehendi, sangeet, Bachelor and bachelorette parties, Roka, Haldi, Baraat and rehersal dinner.
